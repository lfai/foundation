# Reporting Issues
For any issues that may arise within a technical project or a committee, the reporter should first contact the project TSC Chairperson of the technical project or the Chair of the specific committee for initial review and discussion. Ideally the issue will be resolved within the project community with mutual satisfaction. 

If there is a conflict of interest in contacting the TSC Chairperson, TSC voting members or the Chair of a given committee, the reporter should email the Code of Conduct Committee (conduct@lfaidata.foundation) with an overview of the issue, including links to any publicly accessible material relating to the matter. The issue will be reviewed by the Code of Conduct Committee (individuals listed below). An initial response can be expected within three business days. 

The Code of Conduct Committee reserves the right to take appropriate action, potentially including the removal of an individual from any and all participation in the project or committee. 

If a resolution cannot be reached it will be escalated to the Manager of LF Projects, Mike Dolan (manager@lfprojects.org).
