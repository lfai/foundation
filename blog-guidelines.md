# LF AI Foundation Blog Guidelines

## LF AI Blog Overview
The [LF AI Foundation (LF AI) blog](https://lfai.foundation/news/blog/) serves as a channel for LF AI members, project maintainers of graduated and incubating projects, committees, and working groups to share content with the artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) community. 

The content on the LF AI blog consists of:

* Newly graduated or incubating project announcements
* New membership announcements
* Project release information and promotion for graduated or incubating projects
* Cross project collaboration examples among graduated or incubating projects
* Committee activities or updates
* Information or reports about upcoming or recent LF AI events
* AI, ML, or DL technical content and how-to’s 
* Project deployment examples
* Use cases and success stories
* Industry insight into AI, ML, and DL adoption

Other topics are welcome, but should have a direct link to the LF AI community. Blogs from the LF AI Community are welcomed and we encourage the contributions. Accepted blogs are at the sole discretion of the LF AI Foundation. Publishing dates are dependent on availability in the publishing calendar and resources available at the time.

LF AI blog type definitions:

* Project blog: Any blog written about a graduated or incubating project. This is written by or on behalf of the project. If written by a member or LF AI staff about a project, the blog is classified as a Project blog [(Example)](https://lfai.foundation/blog/2020/04/23/forestflow-joins-lf-ai-as-new-incubation-project/). 
* Member blog: Any blog written by a member. A member can write about any open source project relevant to AI, ML, and DL or LF AI [(Example)](https://lfai.foundation/blog/2020/05/26/all-in-open-source-why-i-quit-tech-giant-and-found-my-oss-startup/). If an LF AI member writes solely about an LF AI graduated or incubating project and on behalf of the project, it would be classified as a Project blog [(Example)](https://lfai.foundation/blog/2019/10/30/apache-nifi-ai-fairness-360-aif360-integration-trusted-ai-architecture-development-report-1/). If the blog contains information about an LF AI graduated or incubating project and includes information on how to do something with that project, it is classified as a Member blog [(Example)](https://lfai.foundation/blog/2019/07/26/att-orange-techmahindra-adoption-of-acumos-ai-builds-foundation-for-growth/).
* Committee blog: Any blog written by a committee member is classified as a committee blog. If an LF AI member writes a blog on behalf of the committee, it is classified as a committee blog [(Example)](https://lfai.foundation/blog/2019/08/15/integration-among-tools-key-to-machine-learning-implementation-success/). If a member writes a blog about a committee, it is classified as a Member blog [(Example)](https://lfai.foundation/blog/2019/09/03/improved-project-proposal-process/).
* LF AI Staff: Any blog post written by LF AI Staff. If the staff member is writing a blog on behalf of a project or committee, it is classified as a Project or Committee blog [(Example 1)](https://lfai.foundation/blog/2020/04/27/sparklyr-1-2-0-now-available/), [(Example 2)](https://lfai.foundation/blog/2020/04/29/thank-you-ibm-onnx-for-a-great-lf-ai-day/).

## Blog Content

The LF AI blog audience is developers and the broader AI, ML, and DL open source enthusiasts. Blogs should be intended to teach and give value to the broader LF AI community.

Blog content should incorporate the following:

* Posts from members must be vendor-neutral. The post may mention a vendor’s name as it relates to specific open source project(s), project deployments, adoption paths, the hosting of an in-person event or speaking at an event, or other indications of meaningful participation in the community, but it shouldn’t feel like an advertisement for the member services or company. We do not accept member or company services announcements or press releases to the LF AI blog.
* The most interesting posts are how-to blogs, blogs with technical content, and those that teach or show how to do something in a way others may not have thought of.
* Blog posts that show hurdles that were encountered and explain how they were overcome often do very well as the community is looking to learn.
* Content on how to choose between different technologies and how to accommodate different legacy issues and platforms is a good way to highlight your learnings and share with the community.
* When showing upstreaming of a patch fixing an issue for others, link back to the Github issue, so readers can follow along.
* Critical commentary or broad issues must be approached with sensitivity, professionalism, and tact in a way that is beneficial and positive for the community.
* Your post must be your content, but can be published elsewhere with a right to republish. All content should have an author and be published [Creative Commons with Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/), so you’re welcome to re-publish on your own blog.
* Blog length should be no longer than 1,000 words and no shorter than 300 words
* And it is highly encouraged to include at least one image in the blog, such as diagrams, code examples, or photos

Guest authors can add 1-2 sentences at the end of their blog with a link to an external site such as their website or a gated asset. Example best practices:

* Share contact info of author - email, twitter, slack
* Links to company websites
* Links to project websites or Github
* Advertise if they are hiring and who to contact if interested
* The information should not be a link to the LF AI website or form on the LF AI website. The LF AI PR team will review the statement, as is done for the blog content, to approve the author content. If changes are needed, the LF AI PR team will provide suggested edits.

Note: All blogs must adhere to the [LF AI Code of Conduct](https://lfprojects.org/policies/code-of-conduct/).

## Blog Promotion 
Your blog will be shared on LF AI’s [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LFAI_Foundation) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lfai/) channels. The blog will also be announced via [LF AI mail lists](https://lists.lfai.foundation/g/main/subgroups), as applicable. We encourage you to help amplify the promotion of your blog by retweeting and/or sharing.

## Blog Request Submission
Please submit a blog request form for consideration, the form is available on the [LF AI blog](https://lfai.foundation/news/blog/). You will need to include a brief summary of the blog topic for consideration; or you can supply a link to the blog for review if it’s already drafted. The LF AI PR team will respond with feedback along with a proposed target date for publication; or if it’s not suitable for the LF AI blog, feedback will be provided accordingly.

If you are submitting an article or presentation that already exists, please send it in its entirety with a note on the expressed permission from the owner of the content.

Once your submission is approved, it will be added to the LF AI blog publishing calendar and a publish date will be provided to you so you may plan to promote accordingly through your personal and company social media channels. Please note that publishing dates are dependent on availability in the publishing calendar and resources available at the time. 

We look forward to your blog submission. For questions, please email pr@lfai.foundation.
